## Project Idea: Enhancing Quantum Key Distribution for Quantum Internet Applications

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a pivotal technology for quantum internet applications, ensuring secure communication through the exchange of quantum keys. The reliability and security of QKD systems depend on efficient error correction mechanisms, among other factors.


### Idea Summary

My project proposal aims to enhance Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure quantum internet applications. The primary goal is to integrate Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) measurements into Quantum Error-Correcting (QEC) codes within the QKD system, significantly improving the Secret Key Rate (SKR).
